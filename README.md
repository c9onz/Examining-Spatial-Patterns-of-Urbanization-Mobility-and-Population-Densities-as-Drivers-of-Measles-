[Measles Methodology & Report](https://github.com/c9onz/Examining-Spatial-Patterns-of-Urbanization-Mobility-and-Population-Densities-as-Drivers-of-Measles-/blob/main/Measles-1928-2002-Methodology-and-Report.pdf)
<br>Analysis was conducted in R to study the impact urbanization had in controlling measles transmission pre- and post-vaccination. Applied multilinear regression analysis, heatmapping, autocorrelation, and frequency analysis to measure outbreaks, seasonality, and correlations between population growth and densities against weekly incidence and caseload.
