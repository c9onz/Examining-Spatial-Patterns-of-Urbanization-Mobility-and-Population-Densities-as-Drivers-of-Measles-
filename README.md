<br>Analysis was conducted in R to study the impact urbanization had in controlling measles transmission pre- and post-vaccination. Applied multilinear regression analysis, heatmapping, autocorrelation, and frequency analysis to measure outbreaks, seasonality, and correlations between population growth and densities against weekly incidence and caseload.
